  ## Description 
  This application was designed to allow users to buy and sell used video games. The user can create a personal account and view which games have been posted up for sale. If the user is interested in a game, they can click on the title and will be directed to a new page. The user then has the option to contact the seller through email by selecting the 'Barter' button or purchasing the game through the application by selecting 'Buy Now'. Users also have the option to sell a game by selecting 'View My Inventory', followed by 'Post game'. The user can then upload a picture of their game, select the platform, and add a description and price.
